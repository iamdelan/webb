King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldomly shown
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started sayin' "Peace King" on my song "The Flyest"
And after that, it took off like fire, peace, King
They hardly happy for you, keep doing what you do
You can't please everybody, and not everybody is you
Don't try to force a square peg in a round circle, that shit'll hurt you
Don't try to fit in either, you're better off with neither
Few veteran speakers get medicine when you need it
Especially when we all need knowledge instead of sneakers
Stop hangin' on to childhood trauma, it defeats us
Our challenge is holding ourselves back, I hope you felt that
Queen, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
Queen, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
Queen, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldomly shown
Queen, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
Queen, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
Queen, I started saying "Peace King" on my song "The Flyest"
And after that, it took off like fire, peace, Queen"

"Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real He'll never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother's life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside."

"I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debated on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks, and bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?"
